# This module provides an easy method to create service directories in your application and have them
# populated with runner scripts.

# The methods are available through service.<method name> in your deploy.rb

  # Adds a service to the applications service directory and creates run and log/run scripts
  # 
  # If no runner or logger options are passed, looks for a runner template called <service_name>_runner
  # and a log runner template called <service_name>_log_runner. These should be in the templates directory set
  # with runner_template_path in your deploy.rb.
  #
  # * If the runner template does not exist an exception will be raised
  # * If the logger template does not exist the standard logger template will be used.
  #
  # If you want to use your own template or a string containing rhtml pass a :template option to the appropriate
  # options hash.

  # The default options will be passed through to the template as described in RunitRunnerHelper#create
